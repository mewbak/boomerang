 *============================================================================*/

/* $Revision: 1.1 $
 * 11 Mar 98 - Cristina  
 *  replaced BOOL for bool type (C++'s), same for TRUE and FALSE.
 * 18 Mar 98 - Cristina 
 *  added procedure iterator typedef (PROC_IT), and print() function.
 *  added GetCFG() function and changed the member Cfg to be a non pointer.
 * 24 Jul 98 - Mike
 *  Directly #include ../CFG/cfg.h now
 * 15 Dec 98 - Mike: Coverage functions
 * 16 Dec 98 - Mike: GetCFG() returns a pointer now
 * 08 Jan 99 - Mike: cfg is a pointer now, so can delete the whole CFG
 * 27 Jan 99 - Mike: Added m_bDecoded (in place of m_bIncomplete)
 * 19 Jan 99 - Mike: Removed path to "cfg.h"
 * 07 Apr 99 - Mike: Mods for HEADERS
 * 27 Apr 99 - Mike: Mods to some parameter stuff; added SetLibParams()
 * 29 Apr 99 - Mike: Added m_bDecoded and m_bDecoding, etc
 * 02 Jun 99 - Mike: Removed leading upper case on function names
 * 15 Mar 00 - Cristina: UserProc::setAFP transformed to setAXP
 * 29 Mar 00 - Mike: Removed Type class
 * 14 Jun 00 - Mike: Changes for new Coverage system
 * 21 Jun 00 - Mike: Removed setTailCaller
 * 30 Aug 00 - Sameer/Brian: Added UserProc::getFirstLocalIndex() and
 *              UserProc::getLastLocalIndex() to return the index of the first
 *              and last symbolic local of each procedure.
 * 15 Sep 00 - Mike: matchParams takes a ReturnLocations parameter now
 * 18 Sep 00 - Mike: Removed the last parametrer to matchParams; outgoing is
 *              a reference now (was pointer)
 *              setReturnType() functions now return a bool
 * 20 Nov 00 - Mike: Added getVarType()
 * 19 Dec 00 - Mike: Added checkReturnPass() and checkReturnPassBB()
 * 21 Dec 00 - Mike: Removed replaceParentStackAddresses()
 * 23 Feb 01 - Mike: Added checkMemSizes and findVarEntry for "ninths" test.
 *              Also, symbolMap is totally type insensitive now
 * 13 Aug 01 - Bernard: Added support for type analysis
 * 30 Aug 01 - Mike: Proc's parameters changed from vector to list
 *              Also, findVarEntry returns SemStr* now.
 * 20 Sep 01 - Brian: Added getSymbolicLocals() to return the list of symbolic
 *              locals for a procedure.

     * Modify actuals so that it is now the list of locations that must
     * be passed to this procedure. The modification will be to either add
     * dummp locations to actuals, delete from actuals, or leave it
     * unchanged.
     * Add "dummy" params: this will be required when there are
     *   less live outs at a call site than the number of parameters
     *   expected by the procedure called. This will be a result of
     *   one of two things:
     *   i) a value returned by a preceeding call is used as a
     *      parameter and as such is not detected as defined by the
     *      procedure. E.g.:
     *
     *         foo(bar(x));
     *
     *      Here, the result of bar(x) is used as the first and only
     *      parameter to foo. On some architectures (such as SPARC),
     *      the location used as the first parameter (e.g. %o0) is
     *      also the location in which a value is returned. So, the
     *      call to bar defines this location implicitly as shown in
     *      the following SPARC assembly that may be generated by from
     *      the above code:
     *
     *          mov   x, %o0
     *          call  bar
     *          nop
     *          call  foo
     *
     *     As can be seen, there is no definition of %o0 after the
     *     call to bar and before the call to foo. Adding the integer
     *     return location is therefore a good guess for the dummy
     *     location to add (but may occasionally be wrong).
     *
     *  ii) uninitialised variables are used as parameters to a call
     *
     *  Note that both of these situations can only occur on
     *  architectures such as SPARC that use registers for parameter
     *  passing. Stack parameters must always be pushed so that the
     *  callee doesn't access the caller's non-parameter portion of
     *  stack.
     *
     * This used to be a virtual function, implemented differenty for
     * LibProcs and for UserProcs. But in fact, both need the exact same
     * treatment; the only difference is how the local member "parameters"
     * is set (from common.hs in the case of LibProc objects, or from analysis
     * in the case of UserProcs).
