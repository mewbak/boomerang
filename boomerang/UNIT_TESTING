Unit testing is used throughout boomerang. You shoudl be able to cd to any
directory below the top one, type "make test", and it should make the
objects in that directory and run the test. (In some cases, before dynamic
libraries are installed, you may have to "make ; make install" first).

The tests rely on an open source testing package called cppunit; see
cppunit.sourceforge.net. When that package is installed, testing should
work properly. If you get a message like

ld.so.1: ./testExp: fatal: libcppunit-1.6.so.0: open failed: No such file or directory

then the system isn't finding your cppunit dynamic library. You may need to
do something like this to help it be found:

% export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

You can put this in your .bash_profile, or wherever is approprriate.

If you are in the unfortunate situation (like me) where you do some develop-
ment on a machine where you don't have root access, and don't like to ask
the sysadmins to install things like cppunit, you can work around the problem
my making a soft (symblic) link to the library in the directories. For example,
if you untarred cppunit in /home/myhomedir (and made it, of course), you
could:

% cd db
% ln -s /home/myhomedir/cppunit-1.6.2/src/cppunit/.libs/libcppunit.so .
% make test
