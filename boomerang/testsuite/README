Boomerang's testsuite
=====================

Currently, Boomerang's test set is split into two categories:

* minor: tests that check corner cases, covering code not usually run by other
  tests
* func: functional tests (for now, simply a wrapper around ./testOne.sh,
  replaces ./functest.sh)

More categories may be added in future. The purpose is to make more fine
grained tests, e.g. tests for type analysis, decoding etc.

To run the testsuite, issue this command from Boomerang's source directory:

make check

Note that this used to run Boomerang's unit tests, but they are outdated and
broken at the moment, and people usually expect functional tests to be run with
"make check". In future (after fixing unit tests), a new target will be created
for running them.

Also note that for running Boomerang's testsuite you need DejaGNU installed.
Either install it from your distribution repository or from
http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/.
